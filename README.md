## Project #1. Revolutionizing Bus Routes: A Data-Driven Approach
- **Objective**: In bustling urban environments, optimizing travel efficiency while maintaining public safety is crucial. This project creates a model to propose alternative bus routes that minimize exposure to high-risk areas, thereby enhancing safety and efficiency.
- **Techniques & Skills Demonstrated**: Data Preprocessing and Cleaning, Geocoding and Spatial Analysis, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, User Interface Development, Combinatorial Analysis

## Project #2. Crime Analysis
1. **Objective**: This project seeks to address the challenge of optimizing law enforcement resource allocation and improving public awareness of crime trends.
2. **Techniques & Skills Demonstrated**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization, Natural language processing (NLP), Unsupervised Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition, Geospatial Analysis

## Project #3. Divorce Prediction
1. **Objective**: Divorce is a complex issue influenced by many factors. The challenge is to predict divorce accurately and to identify the most significant predictors.
2. **Techniques & Skills Demonstrated**: EDA, Supervised Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classification, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier, Decision Trees, Random Forest), Ensemble techniques (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking), Model Performance Assessment (Accuracy score, ROC Curve, ROC AUC)
