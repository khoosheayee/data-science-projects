## Project #1. Divorce Prediction
1. **Objective**: Divorce is a complex issue influenced by many factors. The challenge is to predict divorce accurately and to identify the most significant predictors.
2. **Techniques**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Logistic regression, Support vector classification, K-nearest neighbors, Gaussian naive bayes classifier, decision trees, Random forest, Ensemble techniques (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking).
3. **Skills Demonstrated**: Supervised machine learning, model performance assessment.

## Project #2. Crime Analysis
1. **Objective**: This project seeks to address the challenge of optimizing law enforcement resource allocation and improving public awareness of crime trends.
2. **Techniques**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Natural language processing (NLP), K-means clustering, DBSCAN, Hierarchical clustering.
3. **Skills Demonstrated**: Unsupervised machine learning, data visualization, pattern recognition, and geospatial analysis.

## How to Use
1. **Explore the Projects**: Browse through the project folders to see detailed descriptions of each project.
2. **Understand the Methodologies**: Each README file explains the methodologies used and the insights gathered from the analysis.
